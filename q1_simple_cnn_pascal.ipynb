    "# Q1: Simple CNN network for PASCAL multi-label classification (20 points)\n",
    "Now let’s try to recognize some natural images. We provided some starter code for this task. The following steps will guide you through the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Setup the dataset\n",
    "We start by modifying the code to read images from the PASCAL 2007 dataset. The important thing to note is that PASCAL can have multiple objects present in the same image. Hence, this is a multi-label classification problem, and will have to be tackled slightly differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "First, download the data. `cd` to a location where you can store 0.5GB of images. Then run:\n",
    "```\n",
    "wget http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2007/VOCtrainval_06-Nov-2007.tar\n",
    "tar -xf VOCtrainval_06-Nov-2007.tar\n",
    "\n",
    "wget http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2007/VOCtest_06-Nov-2007.tar\n",
    "tar -xf VOCtest_06-Nov-2007.tar\n",
    "cd VOCdevkit/VOC2007/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Write a dataloader with data augmentation (5 pts)\n",
    "**Dataloader** The first step is to write a [pytorch data loader](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/data_loading_tutorial.html) which loads this PASCAL data. Complete the functions `preload_anno` and `__getitem__` in `voc_dataset.py`. \n",
    "* **Hint**: Refer to the `README` in `VOCdevkit` to understand the structure and labeling.\n",
    "* **Hint** : As the function docstring says, `__getitem__` takes as input the index, and returns a tuple - `(image, label, weight)`. The labels should be 1s for each object that is present in the image, and weights should be 1 for each label in the image, except those labeled as ambiguous (use the `difficult` attribute). All other values should be 0. For simplicity, resize all images to a canonical size.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Augmentation** Modify `__getitem__` to randomly *augment* each datapoint. Please describe what data augmentation you implement.\n",
    "* **Hint**: Since we are training a model from scratch on this small dataset, it is important to perform basic data augmentation to avoid overfitting. Add random crops and left-right flips when training, and do a center crop when testing, etc. As for natural images, another common practice is to subtract the mean values of RGB images from ImageNet dataset. The mean values for RGB images are: `[123.68, 116.78, 103.94]` – sometimes, rescaling to `[−1, 1]` suffices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** You should use data in ‘trainval’ for training and ‘test’ for testing, since PASCAL is a small dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### DESCRIBE YOUR AUGMENTATION PIPELINE HERE\n",
    "**Train Augmentations:**\n",
    "I applied random horizontal flips to the input images and resized them to the appropriate input size for the network. I also normalized by the ImageNet image statistics.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test Augmentations:**\n",
    "I used the same augmentations for testing as I did for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Measure Performance (5 pts)\n",
    "To evaluate the trained model, we will use a standard metric for multi-label evaluation - [mean average precision (mAP)](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.average_precision_score.html). Please implement `eval_dataset_map` in `utils.py` - this function will evaluate a model's map score using a given dataset object. You will need to make predictions on the given dataset with the model and call `compute_ap` to get average precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Please describe how to compute AP for each class(not mAP).\n",
    "\n",
    "**YOUR ANSWER HERE**\n",
    "\n",
    "For every training image, the model predicts probabilities for each class. This translates into a binary positive/negative prediction for each class depending on a pre-defined threshold probability (e.g. probability > 0.5). The label for that class in the image is also a binary positive/negative. If the label matches the model prediction, then the model predicted a true positive. The precision for a particular class and threshold is the number of true positives divided by the number of predicted positives. The recall for a particular class and threshold is the number of true positives divided by the number of labeled positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "A precision-recall curve can be generated for a particular class by varying the probability threshold from 0 to 1. The average precision is computed as the area under this curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.4 Let's Start Training! (5 pts)\n",
    "Write the code for training and testing for multi-label classification in `trainer.py`. To start, you'll use the same model you used for Fashion MNIST (bad idea, but let’s give it a shot).\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialize a fresh model and optimizer. Then run your training code for 5 epochs and print the mAP on test set."
